maybe not using pathogen properly. pathogen 
is supposed to manage vim's runtime path,
so the plugins are loaded 

  https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

all the plugins should be cloned into ~/.vim/bundle

there's a .vim directory at the toplevel. It contains two directories, 
'autoload' and 'bundle'. below 'bundle' 'nerdtree' is cloned from

[remote "origin"]
  url = https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

'autoload' has a copy of nerdtree.vim from nerdtree directory

Looks like I need to 
1. mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle; cd !:$
2. git clone git@github.com:scrooloose/nerdtree.git 
3. mkidr -p ~/.vim/autoload  
3. cd /tmp ; git clone git@github.com:tpope/vim-pathogen.git
4. cp vim-pathogen.git/autoload/pathogen.vim ~/.vim/autoload

then edit .vimrc to enable
